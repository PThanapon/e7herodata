Attack is strongly correlated to rarity. In general, a 5 stars hero will have higher base attack than 4 star hero which similarly have higher base attack than 3 star hero.

As evidence of this, the means of base attack by rarity are as follow:
5 stars -> 1084.07
4 stars -> 956.93
3 stars -> 915.32

However, there are certainly exception such as Gunther having really high attack (1426) for a 3 star unit due to his passive.
